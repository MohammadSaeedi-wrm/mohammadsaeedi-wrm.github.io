## Curriculum Vitae
Mohammad Saeedi's research primarily focused on detecting the best-fitting satellite soil moisture products with in situ measurement data over the Lake Urmia basin. The work then shifted toward rainfall estimation using satellite soil moisture data, leading to the development of a new algorithm based on a bottom-up approach.

SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm integrating the SM2RAIN algorithm with the analytical net water flux model.

Currently, Mohammad Saeedi is focused on improving the quality of the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm to enhance rainfall accuracy and expand its application in various studies, including drought, runoff, and irrigation.  <br/>
