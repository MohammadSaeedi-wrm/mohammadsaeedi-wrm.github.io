__[2] SM2RAIN-NWF: A new algorithm by integrating SM2RAIN and the analytical net water flux models.__ `(2020-2022)`
<br/> Using the net water flux analytical model presented by Sadeghi et al. (2019), the SM2RAIN model has been developed. The purpose of this developed algorithm (i.e., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422004437" style="color: blue;">SM2RAIN-NWF</a>) is to estimate rainfall through satellite soil moisture data as the only input using the integration of the SM2RAIN algorithm and the NWF model.

 <img width="21" height="21" alt="question" src="/assets//question.png"> Is the SM2RAIN-NWF algorithm capable of providing more accurate rainfall estimates than the SM2RAIN algorithm? <br/> <img width="21" height="21" alt="question" src="/assets//question.png"> What is the difference between the performance of the two algorithms in estimating rainfall in different land covers?
